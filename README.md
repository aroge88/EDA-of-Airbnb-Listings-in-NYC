# EDA-of-Airbnb-Listings-in-NYC

This report presents an analysis of Airbnb listings using the Python programming language and various data analysis libraries. The dataset used for the analysis is sourced from the "airbnb__2.csv" file. The following libraries were imported for data manipulation and visualization: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy, and Matplotlib.pylab.

The dataset consists of 48,895 rows and 16 columns representing different attributes of Airbnb listings. The columns include information such as listing ID, name, host ID, host name, neighborhood group, neighborhood, latitude, longitude, room type, price, minimum nights, number of reviews, last review date, reviews per month, calculated host listings count, and availability for 365 days.

The analysis begins by loading the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame using the pd.read_csv() function. The dataset is then displayed using the print() function, providing an overview of the data.

Further analysis involves exploring the dataset's structure and statistical summary. The column names are printed using the airbnb.columns command, revealing the names of the columns in the dataset. The airbnb.mean() command calculates the mean values for each numerical column in the dataset, including ID, host ID, latitude, longitude, price, minimum nights, number of reviews, reviews per month, calculated host listings count, and availability for 365 days.

To assess data quality, the number of null values in each column is determined using the airbnb.isnull().sum() command. The output displays the count of null values for each column, highlighting potential missing data in the dataset.

To generate additional insights, two key metrics are calculated. First, the total revenue generated from all Airbnb listings is computed by multiplying the price by the minimum nights and summing the results using the airbnb['Revenue'] = airbnb['price'] * airbnb['minimum_nights'] command. The total revenue is then displayed.

Next, the revenue generated by each neighborhood group is determined using the groupby() function. The top five neighborhood groups with the highest revenue are identified and visualized using a bar plot created with Matplotlib.

Furthermore, the average revenue generated per night for each neighborhood is calculated using the groupby() function. The top five neighborhoods with the highest average revenue per night are identified and presented in a horizontal bar chart, providing insights into the most profitable neighborhoods for Airbnb hosts.

Additionally, the number of listings for each room type is computed using the value_counts() function, followed by the creation of a pie chart to visualize the distribution of listings across different room types.

Lastly, the average price for each room type is determined using the groupby() function and displayed in a bar chart, showcasing the average prices for entire home/apartment, private room, and shared room listings.

# Conclusion:

Based on the analysis of the Airbnb dataset, the following key findings were observed:

1. Total Revenue: The total revenue generated from all Airbnb listings was found to be $62,802,340. This indicates the significant economic impact of the Airbnb platform.
2. Top Revenue by Neighborhood Group: Manhattan emerged as the neighborhood group generating the highest revenue, followed by Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx, and Staten Island. This suggests that Manhattan is the most popular and lucrative area for Airbnb rentals.
3. Average Revenue per Night by Neighborhood: When examining the average revenue generated per night for each neighborhood, it was found that certain neighborhoods consistently generated higher revenue. The top five neighborhoods with the highest average revenue per night were identified as [list top neighborhoods here], indicating their desirability for Airbnb rentals.
4. Listing Count by Room Type: The analysis revealed that the most common room type listed on Airbnb was "Entire home/apt" with 25,409 listings, followed by "Private room" with 22,326 listings, and "Shared room" with 1,160 listings. This indicates a preference for having the entire space when renting on Airbnb.
5. Average Price by Room Type: The average price for each room type was found to be $211.8 for "Entire home/apt," $89.8 for "Private room," and $70.1 for "Shared room." This suggests that renting an entire home or apartment generally comes at a higher price compared to private or shared rooms.

Overall, the analysis provides valuable insights into the Airbnb market, highlighting the neighborhoods with the highest revenue potential and the room types that are in demand. This information can be useful for both Airbnb hosts and potential guests in making informed decisions regarding pricing, location, and room type selection.
